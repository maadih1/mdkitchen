                <h3>Kabab</h3>
                <p>
                    Indulge in the exquisite flavors of kababs, a beloved Pakistani
                    culinary delight. Kababs are succulent pieces of meat, expertly
                    marinated with a harmonious blend of spices and herbs, resulting in
                    a tantalizing symphony of tastes. Grilled to perfection over open
                    flames or in traditional tandoor ovens, kababs offer a smoky,
                    charred exterior that gives way to tender, juicy goodness within.
                    These flavorful morsels can be enjoyed on their own or wrapped in
                    warm naan or paratha, making them a quintessential street food
                    experience that beckons with every savory bite.

                <h3>Kheer</h3>
                <p>
                    Kheer, a beloved dessert in Pakistan, is a creamy and aromatic rice
                    pudding. It's made by simmering rice, milk, and sugar until the
                    mixture thickens to a delightful consistency. Fragrant ingredients
                    like cardamom, saffron, and rosewater are often added to infuse the
                    dessert with a rich and enticing flavor. Kheer can be garnished with
                    chopped nuts, such as almonds and pistachios, and sometimes topped
                    with a sprinkle of rose petals. This sweet and comforting treat is a
                    staple at festivals, celebrations, and family gatherings, cherished
                    for its sweet indulgence and cultural significance.

                <h3>Karahi</h3>
                <p>
                    Karahi is a beloved Pakistani dish known for its rich and robust
                    flavors. It consists of tender pieces of meat, often chicken or
                    mutton, cooked in a heavy, rounded pan called a "karahi." The dish
                    is prepared with a medley of aromatic spices, including coriander,
                    cumin, and ginger, creating a tantalizing and aromatic gravy.
                    Tomatoes, green chilies, and fresh cilantro add a burst of color and
                    freshness to the dish. Karahi is cherished for its spicy kick and
                    smoky essence, making it a popular choice for gatherings and special
                    occasions in Pakistan. Whether served with naan bread or steamed
                    rice, Karahi never fails to delight the taste buds with its
                    authentic and spicy Pakistani flavors.
